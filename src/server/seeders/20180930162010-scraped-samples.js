    title: 'Ted Cruz’s misleading claim: California \'is hemorrhaging population\'',

    <p>Politicians from California and Texas tend to tussle over which state is producing more jobs, or sometimes <a href="https://www.statesman.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/perry-heads-california-job-poaching-trip/48NN4k1hQ0d1TT84ckz4fP/">poaching</a> them, as well as whose <a href="https://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2016/dec/19/jerry-brown/are-jobs-california-growing-hell-lot-faster-texas/">economy is growing faster</a>.</p>
    <p>Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz added fuel to the long-running fight when he claimed California "is hemorrhaging population" in a recent Senate debate with his Democratic challenger Rep. Beto O’Rourke.</p>
    <p>Cruz argued O’Rourke offers Texas a future with higher taxes similar to California.</p>
    <p><em>"There are also states that implement the kind of policies that Congressman O’Rourke supports, high taxes, high regulations, open borders, states--you look at California, which is hemorrhaging population. You know the cost of a one-way U-haul from California to Texas is more than 300% the cost the other way around."</em></p>
    <p><em>Sen. Cruz make his claim in the video above.</em></p>
    <p>In 2014, our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas fact-checked the claim that U-hauls from California to Texas are more expensive. In 2014, they found they cost <a href="https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/mar/12/rick-perry/rick-perry-correct-trucks-cost-half-much-rent-goin/">twice as much </a>as ones headed in the reverse direction.</p>
    <p>For this fact check, we focused on Cruz’s claim about California’s population -- a statement brought to our attention <a href="https://twitter.com/HeffayWrit/status/1044345723968528385">on Twitter</a> by applied demographer Jeffrey Wright.</p>
    <p><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/screen_shot_tweet_cruz_population.JPG" style="height:617px; width:814px"></p>
    <p>We agreed with Wright that it was time for a fact check.</p>
    <p><strong>Our research </strong></p>
    <p>Asked about the claim, Cruz’s campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed to several <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/27/california.dream.census.slump/index.html">news</a> and <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/laoecontax/article/detail/265">government</a> reports on Californians leaving for other states.</p>
    <p>The evidence for that is clear. We explored it in a <a href="https://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/sep/06/john-cox/john-coxs-exaggerated-claim-half-people-want-leave/">recent fact check</a> on Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox when he made an exaggerated claim that "half the people" in California want to leave.</p>
    <p>We reported that California’s once-rapid <a href="http://www.ppic.org/publication/californias-population/">population growth</a> has slowed in recent decades. More people have been leaving for other states than have been moving in from the rest of the country for many years, according to a <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/laoecontax/article/detail/265">February 2018 study</a> by the California Legislative Analyst’s Office.</p>
    <p>About five million people moved to California from other states, while about six million left the state from 2007 to 2016, according to the LAO report, which cited data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/">American Community Survey</a>.</p>
    <p>Here’s who’s moving from and to California, according to the report:</p>
    <p>"Families with kids and those with only a high school education predominate among those moving from California to its top destination states (Texas, Arizona, and Nevada). College-educated 18 to 35 year olds led the way among those moving to California from its top feeder states (New York, Illinois, and New Jersey)."</p>
    <p>But we also found the gap between the number of Californians who left for other states and those who arrived from the rest of the country has narrowed considerably. That gap was several hundred thousand people per year in the 1990s and mid 2000s, but dropped to a few thousand per year during the Great Recession, before again increasing. Still, that’s hardly a "hemorrhaging," especially considering this is only a subset of the state’s overall population.</p>

    <p><strong>Overall population continues to grow</strong></p>
    <p>The migration to other states does not mean California’s overall population is in decline. Just the opposite: It’s grown by an average 333,000 people per year since 2010 largely due to natural births and international migration, according to the California Department of Finance.</p>
    <p>California was home to <a href="http://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Demographics/Estimates/e-1/documents/E-1_2018PressRelease.pdf">39.8 million</a> people as of January 2018, according to the finance department. That included an increase of 309,000 residents in 2017 alone and nearly 2.3 million over seven years.</p>
    <p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
    <p>Sen. Ted Cruz claimed California "is hemorrhaging population" in a recent debate.</p>
    <p>In reality, California’s population has grown by an average of 333,000 per year since 2010 due to natural births and international migration.</p>
    <p>There’s a sliver of truth in Cruz’s statement: The state for many years has lost more people to other states -- including Texas -- than it’s gained from the rest of the country. But even that interpretation of the claim doesn’t show a "hemorrhaging." The gap between Californians leaving for other states and those arriving from the rest of the country narrowed considerably over the past decade.</p>
    <p>In the end, the senator ignored key facts that would give a different impression.</p>
    <p>We rate Cruz’s statement Mostly False.</p>
    <p><em><strong>MOSTLY FALSE –&nbsp;</strong>The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</em></p>`,

    title: 'Trump\'s Distorted Attacks on His Accusers',
    author: 'D\'Angelo Gore',
    publication: 'FactCheck.org',
    body: `
    <p>In a recent press conference, President Donald Trump defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from allegations of sexual misconduct and made claims about some of Trump’s own accusers that were false or lacked evidence.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Trump said, “I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.” Two women told the <em>Hill</em> that their lawyer, Lisa Bloom, either arranged or attempted to arrange financial payments for them, but the paper reported that she “never asked them to make any statements or allegations except what they believed to be true.”</li>
    <li>Trump then claimed another woman told a “total phony story” about being attacked by him “while people were coming onto the plane.” Actually, Jessica Leeds said Trump groped her about 45 minutes into the flight, when the two were sitting in first class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Trump made those claims in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-conference-president-trump-2/">press conference</a> in New York on Sept. 26. He said his opinions of the allegations against Kavanaugh have been shaped by personal experience. “Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me,” Trump said.</p>
    <h5 style="text-align: center;">Trump’s Accusers Were Paid to ‘Make Up Stories’?</h5>
    <p><span>Trump claimed that “four or five women” who have accused him “got paid a lot of money to make up stories.” There’s no evidence of that.</span></p>
    <blockquote><p><b>Trump, Sept. 26:</b><span> I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me. We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television. They refused to even write about it.</span></p>
    <p><span>There were four women, and maybe more — I think the number is four or five. But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000. Another one had other things happen. And the one that reported it, I believe, was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me — and she is the one that reported it. This woman is incredible. She reported it, instead of taking the money.</span></p></blockquote>
    <p><span>Trump appears to be referring to a </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/365068-exclusive-prominent-lawyer-sought-donor-cash-for-two-trump-accusers"><span>story, first reported by the </span><i><span>Hill</span></i></a>,<span> in December 2017, about payments California-based attorney Lisa Bloom acknowledged arranging for two of her four clients who accused Trump of sexual harassment and assault. (At least <a href="http://time.com/5058646/donald-trump-accusers/">18 women</a> have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, according to <em>Time</em>.)<br>
    </span></p>
    <p><span>But the article didn’t say the women were asked to “make up stories” about Trump in exchange for money, as the president said. In fact, the </span><i><span>Hill </span></i><span>reported that the two women “stressed that Bloom never asked them to make any statements or allegations except what they believed to be true.”</span></p>
    <p><span>In one case, Bloom set up a </span><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/stand-up-to-trump"><span>GoFundMe account</span></a><span> that aimed to raise $10,000 — but has so far only collected around $2,600 — to help support Jill Harth, a client who alleged that Trump groped her in 1992 and again in 1993. “She endured a tidal wave of hate for it,” Bloom </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/365010-lisa-blooms-and-jill-harths-statements-to-the-hill"><span>said in a statement</span></a><span> to the </span><i><span>Hill</span></i><span>. “It was very painful for her. And as a New York City makeup artist, Jill lost jobs after she came out publicly against Donald Trump. I believed that people wanted to donate to help her, so we set up the GoFundMe account.”</span></p>
    <p><span>The </span><i><span>Hill</span></i><span> reported that Bloom also secured for Harth “a small payment from the licensing of some photos to the news media,” and arranged for an unidentified donor to pay off the mortgage on Harth’s apartment in Queens. The amount for the mortgage “was under $30,000,” according to the article, not $52,000, as Trump claimed.</span></p>
    <p><span>The </span><i><span>Hill</span></i><span> said that Harth spoke publicly about Trump’s alleged harassment only after her name and the details of the 1997 lawsuit she filed against him surfaced in news reports during the summer before the 2016 election. The fact that Harth filed suit in 1997 undercuts Trump’s claim now that she was paid to make up stories about him. “She asked Bloom to represent her in the fall after hearing Trump describe her allegations against him as false,” the paper said.</span></p>
    <p>“Nothing that you’ve said to me about my mortgage or the Go Fund Me that was created to help me out financially affects the facts or the veracity of my 1997 federal complaint,” Harth <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/365010-lisa-blooms-and-jill-harths-statements-to-the-hill">said in a statement</a> to the <em>Hill</em>.</p>
    <p><span>In the other case, a woman who requested to remain anonymous told the</span><i><span> Hill</span></i><span> that Bloom said she could get as much as $750,000 for “going public with an allegation of an unsolicited advance by Trump on the 1990s beauty contest circuit.” That was actually much lower than the $2 million the woman had requested, citing concerns for her safety, Bloom said. (</span>The woman didn’t dispute the claim that she asked for $2 million. The <em>Hill</em> said she acknowledged trying to see how much she could get or discover who was donating the money.)</p>
    <p>The woman actually supported Trump in 2016, and said “she held no resentment about the early 1990s advance because Trump stopped it as soon as she asked him,” the <em>Hill</em> said.</p>
    <p><span>She</span><span> had been contemplating sharing her story about Trump in order to support her friend Harth, who had put her in contact with Bloom’s law firm. She changed her mind several times about coming forward, but ultimately decided not to go public with her accusation. She later approached the</span><i><span> Hill</span></i><span> with information about Bloom’s financial offers after she learned that Bloom had been representing disgraced film executive Harvey Weinstein, who also has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women.</span></p>
    <p><span>Furthermore, it isn’t exactly accurate that “mainstream media refused to put” the story on TV, or “even write about it,” as Trump claimed. </span></p>
    <p><span>Perhaps no news outlet gave the story as much time as conservative commentator Sean Hannity did on his </span><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2017/12/15/sekulow-were-warrants-issued-based-on-anti-trump-dossier.html"><span>Fox News Channel show</span></a><span> on Dec. 15, 2017. But ABC News did <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/civil-rights-attorney-lisa-bloom-speaks-amid-accusations-51831485">air a segment</a> featuring Bloom’s response to the </span><i><span>Hill</span></i><span>’s report on the weekend edition of “Good Morning America” on Dec. 16, 2017. The </span><i><span>New York Times</span></i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/us/politics/sexual-harassment-politics-partisanship.html"><span>also included some details about Bloom</span></a><span> attempting to arrange payments for clients in a Dec. 31, 2017, story about how “political partisans” on the left and right were “raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support accusers who come forward with charges against President Trump and members of Congress, even amid questions about their motivation.”</span></p>
    <p><span>That </span><i><span>Times</span></i><span> story mentioned that women’s rights attorney Gloria Allred, who is Bloom’s mother, also raised money for her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/30/politics/allred-withdraws-zervos-case/index.html">then-client Summer Zervos</a>, who alleged that Trump kissed and groped her without consent on separate occasions in New York and Los Angeles. Zervos competed on Trump’s old reality TV show, “The Apprentice.” </span></p>
    <p><span>Her defamation lawsuit against Trump, who called her allegations lies, is still ongoing. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-apprentice/trump-to-provide-written-responses-in-summer-zervos-defamation-lawsuit-idUSKCN1LP0Q4">lawyers for Trump and Zervos agreed</a> their clients would provide sworn answers to written questions by Sept. 28.<br>
    </span></p>
    <h5 style="text-align: center;">In Plain Sight?</h5>
    <p>Trump said another woman told a “total phony story” about how he “attacked her while people were coming onto a plane.” That’s not how she described the assault.</p>
    <blockquote><p><strong>Trump:</strong> It’s happened to me many times. I’ve had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane. And I have a number-one bestseller out? I mean it was total phony story. There are many of them.</p></blockquote>
    <p>In October 2016, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?emc=edit_na_20161012&amp;nlid=72023727&amp;ref=cta&amp;_r=0">Jessica Leeds told the <em>New York Time</em>s</a> that Trump “grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt,” according to the paper. She said this happened over three decades earlier, when she was sitting next to Trump in first class on a flight to New York.</p>
    <p>She never claimed it happened as “people were coming onto the plane,” as Trump said. According to the article, the alleged incident happened around 45 minutes into the flight. She alleges Trump moved the armrest and then touched her, causing her to run to the back of the plane. The <em>Times</em> said it spoke with four other people with whom Leeds had shared her story.</p>
    <p>Trump’s campaign later offered its own witness, Anthony Gilberthorpe, who said he saw Leeds and Trump interacting on the plane and that Trump did not make sexual advances on her. “It was she that was the one being flirtatious,” Gilberthorpe said, <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/10/14/trump-camp-puts-forward-witness-to-refute-sex-assault-claim/">according to a note</a> the Trump campaign provided to the <em>New York Post</em>.</p>
    <p>In his press conference, Trump suggested he would never have done what Leeds described because he had “a number-one best-seller out” at the time. But Gilberthorpe claimed he was on the flight with Trump and Leeds in 1980 or 1981.

    title: 'A week to investigate: What a Kavanaugh probe might look like',
    author: 'John Kruzel',
    publication: 'PolitiFact',
    body: `
    <p>President Donald Trump approved a request from the Senate Judiciary Committee for a supplemental background check for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a day after hearing hours of dueling <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/sep/27/your-kavanaugh-ford-hearing-questions-answered/">testimony</a> from him and Christine Blasey Ford, who alleges the would-be justice sexually assaulted her in their youth. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>"I’ve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh’s file," Trump said in a statement.&nbsp;"As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week."&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Senate committee's request&nbsp;followed calls from Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, joined by Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who threatened to derail the nomination if a limited probe were not conducted to examine the allegations.</p>
    <p>"The supplemental FBI background investigation would be limited to current credible allegations" against Kavanaugh and should be completed within a week, the committee said in a statement.</p>
    <p>Earlier that day, Trump, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-fbi-limits-kavanaugh-supreme-co/">who has the authority</a>&nbsp;to reopen the background check,&nbsp;indicated he would&nbsp;defer to senators, saying they should "do what they think is right."</p>
    <p>We reached out to legal experts to better understand what the process might look like.</p>
    <div class="pf_subheadline">What would an investigation entail?</div>
    <p>Legal experts said the list of potential people to interview would be relatively short. Most likely it would center on alleged attendees to a gathering in summer 1982 in suburban Maryland where Ford claims Kavanaugh assaulted her, as well as corroborating witnesses.</p>
    <p>The most relevant source would be Mark Judge, Kavanaugh’s longtime friend who was alleged to be present in two of the three situations Kavanaugh’s accusers reported.</p>
    <p>Judge, through his lawyer, has expressed a willingness to cooperate with investigators.</p>
    <p>During emotional testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford said Judge witnessed the sexual assault Kavanaugh perpetrated against her in the summer of 1982.</p>
    <p>According to Ford, Judge watched as the 17-year-old Kavanaugh muffled Ford’s screams for help while he groped her and fumbled to forcibly remove her clothes — and laughed about it with Kavanaugh immediately afterward. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the attack.</p>
    <p>Judge, who was absent from the hearings,&nbsp;indicated a willingness to cooperate with law enforcement.</p>
    <p>In a statement issued through his lawyer after the hearings concluded, Judge&nbsp;vowed to "cooperate with any law enforcement agency that is assigned to confidentially investigate these allegations."</p>
    <p>That said, Judge’s participation is voluntary. He has no obligation to submit to an interview if he doesn’t want to, experts said, because the FBI lacks the power to subpoena him.</p>
    <p>And unless Judge is subpoenaed, he will control the scope of his cooperation, said Lisa K. Griffin, a law professor at Duke University.</p>
    <p>That means Judge can decline to answer any question for any reason. Were he under subpoena, however, he would have to testify, but he could plead the Fifth Amendment if he asserted that answering a given question might incriminate him.</p>
    <p>The power to subpoena Judge — or anyone else — resides with the Senate Judiciary Committee. But the Republican-led committee specifically shot down a motion to issue a subpoena Sept. 28 when it had the opportunity, said Jens David Ohlin, a law professor at Cornell Law School.</p>
    <div class="pf_subheadline">Would subjects be placed under oath?</div>
    <p>No, said Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. But that doesn’t mean investigation subjects can lie to the FBI with impunity.</p>
    <p>"Lying to the FBI is a crime — a serious one," Ohlin said. "So if Mark Judge submits to an interview then he really needs to tell the truth."</p>
    <p>Under <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap47-sec1001.pdf">federal law</a>, it’s a crime to intentionally falsify, conceal, or cover up material facts amid an FBI background probe of this nature.</p>
    <p>"There are significant penalties for lying to the FBI in these circumstances," Osler said.</p>
    <p>Convictions carry the possibility of being fined or imprisoned up to five years.</p>
    <div class="pf_subheadline">Is it possible the FBI has already looked into the allegations?</div>
    <p>Experts said it’s unlikely the FBI has looked into the behavior Kavanaugh is alleged to have committed as a minor.</p>
    <p>That’s because background investigations "generally concern adult behavior," Griffin said. She added that background investigations "tend to be bounded to a certain extent by the information and references that the subject provides."</p>
    <p>With Trump’s approval, the FBI would be extending the background investigation rather than opening a criminal investigation, she added.</p>
    <p>For that reason, there would be none of the trappings of a criminal investigation — with no prosecutor or grand jury involved. Rather, investigators would gather information and report it back.</p>
    <p>"The FBI finds people, interviews them, and produces a report," Osler said.</p>`,

    title: 'Trump\'s Misleading Boast on Premiums',
    author: 'Lori Robertson',
    publication: 'FactCheck.org',
    body: `
    <p>President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/transcript-interview-donald-trump">repeatedly</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/buzzfeednews/status/919962883546591232?lang=en">said</a> that Obamacare is “dead,” but recently he has been making a misleading boast about low insurance premium growth for 2019 marketplace plans.</p>
    <p><span>Trump claimed that “the rates are far lower than they would have been under the previous administration,” adding, “because we’re managing it very, very carefully.” One study disputes that, and experts say most administration actions in the past two years have driven premiums up.</span></p>
    <p>The actions the administration has taken “by and large have destabilized the market,” said <a href="https://www.kff.org/person/cynthia-cox/">Cynthia Cox</a>, the director of&nbsp;the program for the study of health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>
    <p>Experts also espouse a longer view at the trajectory of premiums for the individual market, where people buy their own insurance, including on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, such as HealthCare.gov. The expected low average premium change for 2019 plans comes after a double-digit increase last year — which was also under the Trump administration and driven by the administration’s elimination of cost-sharing subsidies and uncertainty over the ACA’s future.</p>
    <p>This year, there was less policy upheaval.</p>
    <p>Many of the factors affecting premiums “have settled down this year,”&nbsp;Kelley Turek, the executive director of employer and commercial policy at the insurer trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans, told us. In addition, after several years under the ACA,&nbsp;“we are getting to a point where issuers are getting a better sense of this market,” she said, such as the population, their health costs and how to price plans.</p>
    <p>The president <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-inaugural-meeting-presidents-national-council-american-worker/">made his claim on Sept. 17</a> at an event at the White House to launch the&nbsp;<span>National Council for the American Worker. Trump spoke about new regulations for <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/07/trump-jumps-the-gun-again-on-health-plans/">association health plans</a>, to be created by groups of employers, and then said, “we have the remnants of Obamacare.”</span></p>
    <blockquote><p><strong>Trump Sept. 17:</strong> “But the thing that I really am very happy to announce is that the rates are far lower than they would have been under the previous administration, or under a Democrat administration. We’re holding the rates down. So that remnant is being able to — the remnant of Obamacare is much less expensive than people thought. They were going up, before I got here, at 118 percent, in some cases; 150 percent, 160 percent, 55 percent. We have the percentage going up at a much lower level because we’re managing it very, very carefully. So we’re very proud of that.”</p></blockquote>
    <p>In August, in a Fox News interview, the president similarly <a href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20180823_100000_FOX__Friends/start/2255/end/2280.3">said</a>, “You know, we’ve mostly got it killed … but we’re getting the remnants of Obamacare — the increase is much less than people thought. That’s because of us.”</p>
    <p>The average increase <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/212721/2017MarketplaceLandscapeBrief.pdf">announced</a> by the Department of Health and Human Services in October 2016 — before Trump became president — for the 2017 plan year was 25 percent for the second-lowest cost silver plan available on HealthCare.gov, which covered 38 states. Trump, as <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2016/10/still-cherry-picking-premiums/">he did during the presidential campaign</a>, cherry-picks particularly high increases in certain states or cities, though the highest we found was a 145 percent increase in Phoenix. The rate changes varied widely — Indianapolis saw a 12 percent decrease at the other end of the spectrum.</p>
    <p>It’s worth noting there have been high increases in some states and cities under Trump as well: For the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/258456/Landscape_Master2018_1.pdf">2018 plan year</a>, the average increase was 133 percent in Cedar Rapids, for instance. And the average increase for the second-lowest cost silver plan across HealthCare.gov states for a 27-year-old was 37 percent. Silver level plans in particular increased due to the elimination of cost-sharing subsidies, as we’ll explain.</p>
    <p>After the president made his remarks, HHS Secretary Alex Azar <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/tennessee/articles/2018-09-27/trump-health-chief-premiums-to-drop-for-popular-aca-plan">announced</a> on Sept. 27 that the “benchmark” silver plan, on which federal subsidies are based, is projected to <em>decrease</em> for HealthCare.gov states by 2 percent on average for 2019 plans. He gave credit for that to the president.</p>
    <p>Final rates will be released sometime in October.</p>
    <h5 style="text-align: center;">2019 Premiums</h5>
    <p>It’s true that the premium increases for 2019 plans are expected to be low.</p>
    <p>An analysis <a href="https://www.apnews.com/010810d4bcc44b31aa846497486eebff">published</a> in early September by the Associated Press and the consulting firm Avalere Health of state rate filings by insurers found a 3.6 percent average increase for 47 states and Washington, D.C., for 2019. Avalere Health has since <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisavalere/status/1044644934840651777">updated</a> that figure to 2.8 percent for 48 states plus D.C.&nbsp;The analysis looked at overall premiums in rate filings for 34 states and final rates for 14 states.</p>
    <p>The 2018 premium increase had been about 30 percent on average nationwide, the AP reported.</p>
    <p>HHS reported a 37 percent average increase in the second-lowest cost silver plan for 2018, and, as Azar announced, is now projecting a 2 percent average decrease for HealthCare.gov states for 2019.</p>
    <p>Why is there such a large drop in premium growth?<span></span></p>
    <p>“This year, there was an absence of disruption,” in terms of policy changes, <a href="http://avalere.com/team#!/Dan-Mendelson">Dan Mendelson</a>, the founder of Avalere Health, told us in a phone interview. “In other words, markets were stable.” And the second factor is an expectation of slower growth in medical expenses, a factor he doesn’t think “any politician can take credit for.”</p>
    <p>Others say that low premium growth for 2019 might have been even lower yet were it not for some political disruption this year.</p>
    <p>“Individual market premiums will be higher in 2019 than they would have been without the administrations’ policies,” <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/matthew-fiedler/">Matthew Fiedler</a>,&nbsp;a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings’ Economic Studies Program, told us in an interview.</p>
    <p>Fiedler, who was the&nbsp;chief economist on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration, analyzed what premiums would have been in 2019 in a “stable policy environment,” which meant that the 2018 policies toward the individual market would remain in effect. This scenario, then, would keep the individual mandate penalty next year (which will be eliminated as part of the tax cut law) and wouldn’t include any new regulations on association health plans or short-term limited duration plans (as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/02/trump-health-insurance-costs/">announced</a>&nbsp;by the administration this year to expand these offerings that don’t have to meet all of the requirements of the ACA).</p>
    <p>“I estimate that the nationwide average per member per month premium in the individual market would fall by 4.3 percent in 2019 in a stable policy environment,” Fiedler&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Individual-Market-Premium-Outlook-20191.pdf">wrote</a> in the report.</p>
    <p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects healthier individuals to join those association and short-term plans, which would then increase premiums for those remaining in the individual and small-group markets. CBO <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=2018-06/53826-healthinsurancecoverage.pdf">said</a> in a May report that it expects premiums in those markets to increase by an estimated 2 percent to 3 percent “in most years” due to these measures.</p>
    <p>Mendelson, though, said it would be “a considerable amount of time” before markets form for those plans.</p>
    <p>Average premiums also may be going up more slowly for 2019 because some insurers increased premiums substantially last year.</p>
    <p>“There have been a lot of balls in the air in the policy realm and some uncertainty that really set into premiums last year,” Turek, with America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in an interview.</p>
    <p>Among that uncertainty: a debate over repealing and replacing the ACA in Congress, concern that the individual mandate would end, and the administration’s elimination of <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/video-cost-sharing-subsidies/">cost-sharing subsidies</a>, or cost-sharing reductions, that were paid to insurers to reduce out-of-pocket costs for low-income policyholders.&nbsp;The ACA caps the amount policyholders have to spend out of pocket on deductibles, copays and coinsurance, and the cost-sharing subsidy lowers that cap. The insurers were still required to offer the lower-cap policies even though the administration ended the subsidy payments in October 2017.</p>
    <p>“Those are all factors that led to some larger premium increases for the 2018 year,” Turek said.</p>
    <p>Cox, with the Kaiser Family Foundation, similarly told us that premiums are growing more slowly this year than in the past because insurers have been overpriced this year. “Going into 2018 insurers raised their rates significantly in large part because of this political uncertainty. In some cases, I think it’s likely insurers guessed too high,” she said.</p>
    <p>In particular, insurers were encouraged in many states to increase premiums for silver-level plans, more so than bronze or gold plans, because of the loss of the cost-sharing subsidies, which applied only to silver-level plans.</p>
    <p>The Kaiser Family Foundation’s <a href="https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/tracking-2019-premium-changes-on-aca-exchanges/">tracking of insurer rate filings</a>&nbsp;for 2019 plans has found about a 5 percent increase in the second-lowest cost silver plans for a 40-year-old in cities for which there is complete data, Cox said in an interview. As we’ve seen in other years, the rate changes vary across the country, from a 24 percent decrease in Philadelphia to a 23 percent increase in Burlington, Vermont.</p>
    <p>Many insurers built in increases last year anticipating that the individual mandate would be eliminated. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ <a href="http://www.actuary.org/files/publications/Premium_Drivers_2019_061318.pdf">June brief</a> on the drivers of 2019 premium increases acknowledges this as well, saying that the elimination of the mandate would drive premiums up next year to the extent that it “hasn’t already been incorporated into premiums.”</p>
    <p>But AHIP,&nbsp;in a brief it published earlier this year, still <a href="https://www.ahip.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2019Premiums_IssueBrief_FINAL.pdf">estimated</a> a 9 percent to 10 percent increase in premiums for 2019 due to the repeal of the mandate penalty.</p>
    <h5 style="text-align: center;">Administration Actions</h5>
    <p>That AHIP brief also estimated increases due to medical costs, and the regulations on association and short-term plans. However, it estimated a 3 percent decrease in premiums due to a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/195">one-year moratorium</a> in 2019 on a tax on health insurers.</p>
    <p>Experts said that’s one move the administration has made that would drive premiums down.</p>
    <p>States also have taken actions to depress premium growth. Some states have proposed, and the administration has approved, <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180823.322471/full/">waivers to create reinsurance programs</a>, which will reimburse insurers for high-dollar medical claims. Seven states have received such waivers, according to the journal <em>Health Affairs</em>.</p>
    <p>Whether the <em>states</em> or the <em>administration</em> gets credit for those waivers is a matter of opinion. Azar gave credit to the president for the approval of the waivers in his remarks on Sept. 27.</p>
    <p>Azar also cast the administration’s actions on cost-sharing subsidies as a positive, even though experts say ending the subsidies drove premiums up. He said, “We took bold action to fix a lawless situation in which the previous administration made payments to insurers that Congress never funded.” Azar said the president supported a bipartisan bill to “fix this situation,” which was <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/17/alexander-and-murray-say-theyve-struck-bipartisan-obamacare-deal-243872">a measure</a>&nbsp;to reinstate the cost-sharing payments for at least two years. It&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/71945">failed</a>.</p>
    <p>The CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53799">have estimated</a>, based on insurers’ rate filings, that premiums for silver-level plans are about 10 percent higher on average for 2018 due to the elimination of the cost-sharing payments, and the “agencies project that the amount will grow to roughly 20 percent by 2021.” Those receiving premium tax credits to buy insurance are also now receiving larger tax credits, since those are based on the silver plans.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.kff.org/person/larry-levitt/">Larry Levitt</a>, senior vice president for health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation, <a href="https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/1045352144679854080">tweeted</a> that there was a stabilizing effect from eliminating the cost-sharing payments. “Ironically, one of the most stabilizing actions the Trump administration has taken was cutting of cost-sharing subsidy payments to insurers. That led to an increase in ACA benchmark premiums this year, which in turn led to higher premium subsidies and more stable enrollment,” he said on Sept. 27.</p>
    <p>Overall, Levitt <a href="https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/1045347406567550977">said</a>, “ACA premiums are stable for 2019 because they went up so much this year due to an uncertain environment and regulatory actions by the Trump administration. Premiums would be going down a lot if not for repeal of the individual mandate penalty and expansion of short-term plans.”</p>
    <p>This year, the administration also ended, but then <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/25/17611808/obamacare-trump-lawsuit-risk-adjustment">reinstated</a>, payments to insurers for a risk-adjustment program that compensates insurers that cover more high-risk consumers. The program had been challenged in court, and the administration issued a new rule giving further justification for the financial formula the program uses. If the program had ended entirely, premiums would have gone up.</p>
    <p>The HHS secretary also cited an <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-24/pdf/2017-01799.pdf">executive order</a> that Trump signed his first day in office, which called for HHS and other agencies to “delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the [ACA] that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals or health care providers” and called for “greater flexibility to the States.”</p>
    <p>And he cited new rules <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-issues-final-rule-increase-choices-and-encourage-stability-health-insurance-market-2018">issued by HHS in April&nbsp;2017</a> to reduce the open enrollment period for the individual market by half, add documentation requirements for those buying plans under special enrollment periods — such as after getting married or having a child, allow insurers to require past-due premium payments before an individual could reenroll, and allow a little more variation for insurers in actuarial value requirements for plans. Actuarial value is the percentage of health care costs paid by a plan for the population of enrollees.</p>
    <p>In our interview with Cox, she noted that shortening the open enrollment period could be seen as a way to limit the enrollment of those with medical conditions, which would drive down premiums. But that began last year.</p>
    <h5 style="text-align: center;">Premium Increases Since 2014</h5>
    <p>Overall, experts talk about the long-term trajectory of these individual market premiums under the ACA.</p>
    <p>The ACA’s exchanges, and new individual market rules, launched in 2014. Among the major provisions: The law prohibited insurers from pricing plans based on health status or gender, required insurers to accept all consumers regardless of health status, set minimum benefit standards for plans, and required individuals to have insurance or pay a penalty.</p>
    <p>Here’s how premiums have increased each year since then, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, for plans on HealthCare.gov for a 27-year-old. (Individuals can buy plans directly from an insurer or through a broker as well, but those getting subsidies must buy through HealthCare.gov or a state-run exchange.)</p>
    <p><a href="https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/hhs-chart.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-146343" src="https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/hhs-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/hhs-chart.png 1722w, https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/hhs-chart-234x145.png 234w, https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/hhs-chart-768x476.png 768w, https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/hhs-chart-572x355.png 572w" sizes="(max-width: 1722px) 100vw, 1722px" width="1722" height="1068"></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Note: “PY” stands for plan year. The 2018 plan year premiums would have been set in late 2017.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the Kaiser Family Foundation <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/marketplace-average-benchmark-premiums/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D">has measured</a>&nbsp;the average premiums for the second-lowest cost silver-level plan for a 40-year-old, weighted by the plan selections in each county. That shows a 1 percent increase from 2014 to 2015, 8.3 percent increase from 2015 to 2016, 20 percent increase from 2016 to 2017, and 34 percent increase from 2017 to 2018.</p>
    <p>Cox told us there were some “growing pains” in the first few years of the ACA exchanges, as insurers learned how to operate in this market.</p>
    <p><span>The increase from 2016 to 2017, said Fiedler, was a “correction year,” as insurers had underpriced in the first few years of the ACA. And then, for the 2018 plan year, the increase was driven by uncertainty over the future of the health care law, and the administration’s decision to end the cost-sharing subsidies.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Mendelson said it takes time for new markets to stabilize, and that’s finally happening in the post-ACA individual market as the political disruption has died down this year.&nbsp;The slowdown in premium growth for 2019 is “part of a natural process of stabilizing the market,” he said.</p>`,

    title: 'Ad misleads about NC governors opposing constitutional amendments',
    author: 'Paul Specht',
    publication: 'PolitiFact',
    body: `
    <p>A new political ad suggests that each of North Carolina’s living former governors opposes proposed constitutional amendments on the November ballot.</p>
    <p>There are six proposed amendments that would change the state Constitution.</p>
    <p>One would require voters to show photo ID to participate in future elections. Another would enshrine the "right to hunt and fish" in the Constitution. Others would cap the state income tax rate at 7 percent and grant victims of crime the right to know specific legal information.</p>
    <p>Then there are the pair of proposed amendments that would reduce the governor’s power by limiting his or her&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sosnc.gov/divisions/nc_constitutional_documents/s814">authority to fill judicial vacancies</a>&nbsp;and shifting the responsibility for appointing elections board members from the governor to the legislature.</p>
    <p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/StopDeceptiveAmendments/videos/318865002256445/">commercial</a>, a narrator opens by asking viewers to "take a closer look at constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall."</p>
    <p>"Every former chief justice and every former governor — Democrats and Republicans — all recommend voting no," the narrator continues.</p>
    <p>"They say these amendments are purposefully vague, a blank check for politicians who could block corruption investigations and strip all of our courts of independence, permanently. The closer you look at these misleading amendments, the worse they get. Vote no."</p>
    <p>Each of the amendments was put on the ballot by the legislature, which is controlled by Republicans. The commercial was paid for by the Stop Deceptive Amendments political committee, which is treasured by Michael Weisel. Weisel is an elections attorney who the Associated Press recently described as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apnews.com/ad74eac3aafd41b89ffd1511bb88b08b" target="_blank">a prominent figure on the political left</a>.<br>
    <br>
    The group bought airtime with WRAL-TV in Raleigh and Charlotte’s WSOC-TV, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article219017685.html">Charlotte Observer</a>&nbsp;reported Tuesday.</p>
    <p>Given that most North Carolinians are likely more familiar with governors than former chief justices, let’s turn our attention there. Is it true that every living former governor — including Republicans Pat McCrory and Jim Martin — opposes each of the six amendments?</p>
    <p>Put simply: no.</p>
    <p><strong>Republican support</strong></p>
    <p>While&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article216454675.html">all former governors made news recently</a>&nbsp;for opposing the amendments that affect the governor’s office, McCrory reaffirmed his support of the voter ID, victims’ rights, tax cap and hunting and fishing amendments during his radio show Monday morning. "It’s a false and misleading ad," McCrory said on&nbsp;<a href="https://wbt.radio.com/blogs/pat-mccrory-show-w-bo-thompson/pat-mccrory-show-bo-thompson-deceptive-commercials-are-out-and">WBT Radio in Charlotte</a>.</p>
    <p>He also said he sent a letter to various media stations asking them to stop airing the ad, and threatened legal action if they don’t.</p>
    <p>"I demand that you immediately take down these advertisements, since they falsely impute to me a position which I have vocally opposed in the media, and further because such falsehoods inflict ongoing damage both to my reputation and to the campaign to pass Marsy’s Law, on which I am a prominent supporter and endorser," the letter says.</p>
    <p>Marsy’s Law is another name for the victims’ rights amendment. Chris Sinclair, an advocate for the proposed amendment, emailed PolitiFact a photo of McCrory speaking at a Marsy’s event at Latta Park in Charlotte on Sept. 10.</p>
    <div class="artembed"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/McCroryMarsysLawSmall.png"></div>
    <p>Martin, for his part, told us in an email that he holds the same view of the amendments that McCrory does.</p>
    <p>"Personally, I am opposed to the two previously identified amendments that remove appointive authority from the governor and transfer it to the legislature (for all practical purposes, to its leadership)," Martin’s email says. "They appear to be the last two of the referendum amendments on all ballots. I am not opposed to the other amendments."</p>
    <p><strong>A denial</strong></p>
    <p>Weisel, when contacted by PolitiFact, referred us to Stop Deceptive Ads spokesman Justin Guillory. Guillory said Tuesday the ad doesn’t, in fact, suggest that all former governors oppose all of the constitutional amendments.</p>
    <p>"The ad clearly references two amendments that would give additional appointment powers to the state legislature. Those are the same two amendments that McCrory opposes," Guillory wrote in an email.</p>
    <div class="artembed"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/GovsNOSmall.jpg"></div>
    <p>"We appreciate Gov. McCrory’s bipartisan leadership in opposing these two amendments and that’s why we chose to feature the five former governors in our ads," he continued. "Part of what is confusing about these constitutional amendments is that the legislature didn’t allow titles or any other identifiers on the ballot. There are no titles for us to reference in an ad."</p>
    <p>Guillory has a point: The amendments on the ballot will lack numbers or titles. (Read them on the N.C. Secretary of State&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sosnc.gov/divisions/nc_constitutional_documents/nc_constitutional_amendments">website</a>.)</p>
    <p><strong>What the ad says</strong></p>
    <p>Let’s look again at what the narrator says.</p>
    <p>Guillory says the ad is talking only about the two amendments related to gubernatorial powers. He says the narrator alludes to those two when saying they would "block corruption investigations and strip all of our courts from independence."</p>
    <p>But the ad makes no clear distinction between the two amendments affecting the governor’s powers, and the four others.</p>
    <p>The narrator says, "Take a closer look at constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall." There’s no reason viewers would think to look at only two of them, specifically.</p>
    <p>Immediately after that, the narrator says: "Every former chief justice and every former governor — Democrats and Republicans — all recommend voting no."</p>
    <p>Again, there’s no distinction.</p>
    <p><strong>A change</strong></p>
    <p>Wednesday evening, Guillory sent an email announcing that the group had changed the ad.</p>
    <p>In the new version, the narrator begins the ad specifying the amendments that affect the governor’s power.</p>
    <p>"Take a closer look at two constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall," the narrator says.</p>
    <p>Guillory says Stop Deceptive Amendments stands by its original version, but that "defeating these two amendments is more important than a political spat.</p>
    <p>"We’ve sent a revised version of the ad to TV stations that clarifies which two amendments the five governors oppose," Guillory said.</p>
    <p>"We continue to appreciate Gov. McCrory’s bi-partisan leadership in opposing these two amendments and the courage it takes for him to confront the legislative leaders of his own party. We look forward to working with leaders of both parties to defeat these two dangerous and misleading amendments."</p>
    <p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>
    <p>The original Stop Deceptive Amendments commercial suggests that every former North Carolina governor opposes all six constitutional amendments. That’s not true. McCrory and Martin (the only two former Republican governors who are still living) oppose the two amendments that affect the governor’s powers, but support the other four amendments. While PolitiFact appreciates the group’s effort to be more accurate, we must set the record straight for those who have already seen the original ad and rate this claim False.</p>
