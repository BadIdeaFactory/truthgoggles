# Truth Goggles

People are protecting their identities when consuming information.

Truth Goggles is a browser tool to help users think more carefully when
reading information.

## About the Code

There is no code yet!  But it will likely be a Node backend connected
to a browser plugin.

## Goggles History
The original Truth Goggles was a prototype developed at the MIT Media
Lab's Center for Civic Media in 2012.  It resulted in a thesis and a
proof of concept demonstration.  The demo was a piece of javascript
that would identify phrases that perfectly matched known fact checks.

Once a fact check was found in the content of an article, Truth Goggles
would kick in and try to combat known biases and backfire effects using
interface tricks.  In theory it helped people walk away with more
nuanced perspectives about information than they would have had without
the goggles.

This project is going to pick up on the spirit of that project, aided by
five years worth of improvements to natural language processing.
